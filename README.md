# 🧠 100 Days of JavaScript Problem Solving

Welcome to my **Daily JavaScript Problem Solving Challenge!**  
This journey is all about improving logic, sharpening problem-solving skills, and mastering JavaScript one problem at a time.

---

## 🚀 About the Challenge
I’ve started this challenge to build consistency and get better at writing efficient, clean JavaScript code.  
Each day, I’ll solve **one coding problem**, share my **solution**, and explain my **approach**.

---

Copy code

Each folder contains:
- `problem.md` → question statement  
- `solution.js` → my JavaScript solution with comments  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving mindset  
- Master core JavaScript logic (loops, arrays, objects, algorithms)  
- Write cleaner, more readable code  
- Build daily consistency  

---

## 🧩 Topics I’ll Cover
- Arrays & Strings  
- Recursion  
- Sorting & Searching  
- Objects & Maps  
- Math-based Problems  
- Promises & Async Logic (later stages)

---

## 🔥 Progress
| Day | Problem | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Reverse a String | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Find the Largest Number | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Coming Soon... | ⏳ |

## 💡 How I Approach Problems
1. Read the problem carefully  
2. Break it into smaller steps  
3. Think of edge cases  
4. Write a first version  
5. Optimize and refactor  

---

## 🧰 Tools
- **Editor:** VS Code  
- **Runtime:** Node.js  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
